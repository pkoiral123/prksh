									<h2>Graduate Research Assistant<br/></h2>
									<p> I have worked as an active member of Advanced Combustion and Renewable Fuels (ACRF) Laboratory for about two year period. I have performed my research works on computational models and methods as applied to internal combustion engines where I used CONVERGE, ANSYS Fluent, ABAQUS, SolidWorks, MATLAB and Tecplot as main tools. Additonally, I performed all my simulations on Palmetto High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster.</p>

								<p> As a member of Clemson ACRF Lab, I spend my time on several projects utilizing the modeling tools like CFD and FEA. I worked on thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on advanced low temperature gasoline compression ignition (LT-GCI) combustion mode and also on coventional diesel combustion. In this advanced combustion mode, the modeling predicted an efficiency gain of about 0.5 percentage points by minimizing the heat transfer losses across the piston walls which is due to temperature swing phenomenon of TBCs. I, along with my modeling team developed a CFD-FEA Co-simulation framework where the near wall bondary conditions from CFD were fed into FEA so that a more accurate prediction of piston surface temperature swing could be done which is essential for TBCs. In order to input the boudary conditions to FEA, we developed a MATLAB script that computes near wall gas temperature and heat transfer coefficient at each crank angle during the engine cycle. </p>

								<h2>Core Member<br/></h2>
								<p> As a core member of Robotics and Automation Center (RAC) at Tribhuvan University (TU) Thapathali Campus for more than a year, I performed several national as well as international projects. The projects were mainly focused on designing, and fabricating automatic as well as manual robots according the competition requiremnts. I, along with our team participated in IIT Techfest Bombay, YANTRA 7.0 Automatic and Manual Akhada, </p>

									<h2>Service Engineer<br/></h2>
									<p> I have done my internship as a Service Engineer at Ford Motor Company in Kathmandu, Nepal for four months. I got an opportunity to get exposed to the practical knowledge of the automobile components and understanding the work and ethics of the organization as well as basic process of job handling. </p>

							<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p> From this internship, I developed the skill of identifying most of the components and opening and closing of job card with the help of auto deal. The supervisors engaged us to work in the initial phase which helped to uplift our enthusiasm towards work. The technicians were very helpful and cooperated us well and made easy to learn and distinguish different parts and mechanism of cars and taught us the process of repair and maintenance.I was able to enhance my technical and managerial skills. I got familiarized with the vehicle system and its latest models. Various new and advanced technologies have been developed in modern cars like automatic transmission system, use of various sensors, antilock braking systems, air bags, four Wheel drive system etc.     </p>
