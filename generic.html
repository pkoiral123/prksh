									<h3>Graduate Research Assistant<br/></h3>
									<ul class="actions special">
									<p> I have worked as an active member of Advanced Combustion and Renewable Fuels (ACRF) Laboratory for about two year period. I have performed my research works on computational models and methods as applied to internal combustion engines where I used CONVERGE, ANSYS Fluent, ABAQUS, SolidWorks, MATLAB and Tecplot as main tools. Additonally, I performed all my simulations on Palmetto High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster.</p>

								<p> As a member of Clemson ACRF Lab, I spend my time on several projects utilizing the modeling tools like CFD and FEA. I worked on thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on advanced low temperature gasoline compression ignition (LT-GCI) combustion mode and also on coventional diesel combustion. In this advanced combustion mode, the modeling predicted an efficiency gain of about 0.5 percentage points by minimizing the heat transfer losses across the piston walls which is due to temperature swing phenomenon of TBCs. I, along with my modeling team developed a CFD-FEA Co-simulation framework where the near wall bondary conditions from CFD were fed into FEA so that a more accurate prediction of piston surface temperature swing could be done which is essential for TBCs. In order to input the boudary conditions to FEA, we developed a MATLAB script that computes near wall gas temperature and heat transfer coefficient at each crank angle during the engine cycle. </p>

										<h3>Design Engineer<br/></h3>
										<ul class="actions special">
											
										<p> I worked as an Engine design and modeling engineer at Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) Laboratory for about six months duration since January 2022. I worked along with three other members in the project regarding plastic waste and used cooking oil as an alternative fuel in IC engine. All the blends of biodiesel taken under our research shows engine performance as good as pure diesel such as indicated power, brake power, indicated thermal efficiency, brake thermal efficiency etc. The CFD modeling was performed in ANSYS Fluent where the model was validated against the experimental results. All the engine components were designed and modeled in SolidWorks followed by simulation on Fluent. A biodiesel blend of 15%-25% could be used as alternative fuel source in IC engine but to be specific; blend of 25% biodiesel is best suited and much more useful as maximum of diesel could be replaced. The modeling results agreed with experiment predicting a blend of 25% biodiesel as best suited and much more useful as maximum of diesel could be replaced. All the samples used for emission test were better than pure diesel. B20 sample resulted to an extraordinary emission performance while using in ford diesel engine. Thus, blends of high-grade plastic oil with diesel up to 20% by volume and blends of low-grade plastic oil diesel up to 10% by volume show a high cetane index of the fuel which improves the combustion characteristics of the engine.</p>

										<h3>Lecturer<br/></h3>
										<ul class="actions special">
										<p> As a Lecturer for 'Automotive Component Design' course for a year at Tribhuvan University, I taught undergraduate students about the basics of designing automotive components like engine valves, gears, piston, etc. I also covered such multiple problem solving techniques under real life scenarios. My responsibilities included developing and delivering lectures, creating and grading assessments, and providing additional support during office hours. I successfully engaged students through interactive teaching methods and improved their understanding of critical concepts in automotive design.</p>

										<h3>CFD Engineer<br/></h3>
										<ul class="actions special">
											<p> I worked as CFD modeler for Darshan Consulting Services at Kathmandu, Nepal for more than two years. I was working on national as well as international projects related to hydraulic structures of hydropower projects since December, 2019. In the national projects, I performed hydraulic modeling for the reservoir operation with sediment bypass tunnel. It also includes checking the behavior of downstream of bypass intake gate where it was concluded that the proposed sediment by pass tunnel can extract about 80% of the sediment load. Similarly, other national level prjects includes Phukot Karnali Hydroelectric Porject, Rasuwagadhi Hydroelectric Project, etc. The international level projects inlcudes Baime Hydropower at Papua New Guinea, where numerical CFD modeling was used to verify design calculations made for excess flow from side channel spillway, stilling basin, and flow regime at intake. On top of that, Tsak Valley was another project where CFD Model test was performed using Flow 3D with the team for checking capacity of canal, flow under sluice high floods and efficiency of settling basin. </p>

								<h3>Core Member<br/></h3>
								<ul class="actions special">
								<p> As a core member of Robotics and Automation Center (RAC) at Tribhuvan University (TU) Thapathali Campus for more than a year, I performed several national as well as international projects. The projects were mainly focused on designing, and fabricating automatic as well as manual robots according the competition requiremnts. I, along with our team participated in IIT Techfest Bombay, YANTRA 7.0 Automatic and Manual Akhada, and several national level competitions conducted within Tribhuvan and Kathmandu University.  </p>

									<h3>Service Engineer<br/></h3>
									<ul class="actions special">
									<p> I have done my internship as a Service Engineer at Ford Motor Company in Kathmandu, Nepal for four months. I got an opportunity to get exposed to the practical knowledge of the automobile components and understanding the work and ethics of the organization as well as basic process of job handling. </p>

							<div class="image main"><img src="images/Internship.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p> From this internship, I developed the skill of identifying most of the components and opening and closing of job card with the help of auto deal. The supervisors engaged us to work in the initial phase which helped to uplift our enthusiasm towards work. The technicians were very helpful and cooperated us well and made easy to learn and distinguish different parts and mechanism of cars and taught us the process of repair and maintenance. I was able to enhance my technical and managerial skills. I got familiarized with the vehicle system and its latest models. Various new and advanced technologies have been developed in modern cars like automatic transmission system, use of various sensors, antilock braking systems, air bags, four Wheel drive system etc.     </p>
