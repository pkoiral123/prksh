									<h3><a href="images/MSThesis_PrakashKoirala.pdf">Investigation of effects of thermal barrier coatings
									on gasoline compression ignition combustion</a></h3>
								<header>
									<p> This is the project of my MS Thesis. A coupled modeling of CFD and FEA to simultaneously analyze fluid flow and structural behaviors under various conditions was used until a quasi-steady state was achieved. A coating material called Gadolinium Zirconate (Gd-Zr) was used for TBC on the piston of a GCI engine running at 1500rpm and at three different operating conditions of 6-bar, 10-bar, and 15-bar. The goal was to use modeling to determine how this coating affects the engine's performance. We found that the TBC made the engine's surface temperature swing more than 100K, and this helped reduce heat loss from the gas to the walls, making the engine more efficient. </p>

										<h3><a href="images/8150FinalReport.pdf">Design of 
										Battery pack</a></h3>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/batterypack.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A battery module was design and fabricated such that multiple modules could be connected in series to achieve a higher voltage output. The four battery modules were connected in series and produced a voltage of 44.9 V where individual module was tested in the Arbin at a charge and discharge current of 20 A. </p>

										ratios in GCI combustion: A CFD Simulation Study</a></h3>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sootmodeling.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The effect of start of injection timing, and fuel composition on the soot emissions for gasoline ethanol blend ratios of E10 and E50 under ten bar conditions were studied. The amount of soot mass was found to be lower for E50 comparatively due to higher ethanol content. The soot emissions was found to be maximum for -31 CAD SOI1 conditions and followed the trend SOI -31 > SOI -25 > SOI -19 CAD.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/optimization.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The optimization of the wing design for a HALE UAV with a key emphasis on maximizing aerodynamic efficiency and endurance was perfomed using XFLR5, modeFRONTIER and MATLAB. Brute-force optimization method was used and achieved a 40-hour endurance at an optimal fuel consumption rate of 100 kg/hour. </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/6610new.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A series HEV was modeled and simulated in Simulink in reference to US06 drive cycle. This powertrain model improved vehicle MPGe by 24.65% and MPG by 7.75% compared to vehicle with similar powertrain configuration. It helped the vehicle to maintain the battery SOC within 60%-65% which reduce the range discharge-charge fluctuations during  operaton resulting increase in vehicle battery life.</p>

										<h3><a href="#">Design, and Analysis of Closed Circuit 
									    Low Speed Subsonic Wind Tunnel</a></h3>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Subsonictunnel.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> A complete design methodology for a closed circuit subsonic wind tunnel with an axial fan and flow analysis using CFD simulations (ANSYS Fluent) for the designed wind tunnel was performed. Wind tunnel with test section of
										2.60 × 1.84 m and maximum test section velocity of 100 m/s was designed. Using
										analytical methods, overall dimensions and loss coefficients for each component was
										calculated that yield Energy ratio of 6.9. For this obtained Energy ratio, a single stage
										axial fan was designed by implementing the isolated airfoil theory for blade design and
										free vortex flow for three-dimensional flow equilibrium.</p>

										<h3><a href="#">Design, Analysis and Evaluation of
										Electric All Terrain Vehicle (E-ATV)</a></h3>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/underproject.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The vehicle frame as well as all the systems are designed, modeled and analyzed using SolidWorks, ANSYS, MATLAB and Simulink. Two different roll cage models were designed and a crash testing was performed where a suitable model was selected from the analysis. The overall tractive power requirement to run EATV at an average velocity of 25 km/hr on 25% grade was found to be 10.57 kW, assuming the range to be 40 km in one full charge. Double wishbones system was selected for suspension whereas disc brakes was selected for braking system. Similarly, rack and pinion steering system was designed and used rather than power steering system.  </p>
